## `create_scheduled_task.py` & `lambda_1.zip`
### Summary
This code defines a function named `create_scheduled_task` that creates a new task in a DynamoDB table. The function takes an event and context as inputs, and returns a response indicating the success or failure of the task creation.

### Example Usage
```python
event = {
    'task_name': 'Task 1',
    'cron_expression': '0 0 * * *'
}
context = {}

response = create_scheduled_task(event, context)
print(response)
```

### Code Analysis
#### Inputs
- `event` (dictionary): Contains the task name and cron expression for the new task.
- `context` (dictionary): Contains information about the execution context of the function.
___
#### Flow
1. Generate a unique ID for the task using `uuid.uuid4()`.
2. Retrieve the task name and cron expression from the `event` dictionary.
3. If any of the required input data is missing, return a response with a status code of 400 and an error message.
4. Create an item dictionary with the task ID, task name, and cron expression.
5. Attempt to insert the item into the DynamoDB table using `table.put_item()`.
6. If successful, return a response with a status code of 200 and a success message along with the task ID.
7. If an exception occurs during the insertion, return a response with a status code of 500 and an error message.
___
#### Outputs
- Response dictionary with the following keys:
  - `statusCode` (integer): The status code indicating the success or failure of the task creation.
  - `body` (string): A JSON-encoded string containing a message about the task creation status and the task ID.

## `list_scheduled_task.py` & `lambda_2.zip`
### Summary
This code defines a function named `list_scheduled_task` that retrieves all items from a DynamoDB table and returns them as a JSON response. If the retrieval is successful, it returns a 200 status code along with the items. If an exception occurs, it returns a 500 status code along with an error message.

### Example Usage
```python
response = list_scheduled_task(event, context)
```

### Code Analysis
#### Inputs
- `event` (dictionary): Contains information about the event that triggered the function.
- `context` (object): Provides methods and properties related to the execution context of the function.
___
#### Flow
1. The function attempts to scan all items from the DynamoDB table.
2. If the scan is successful, it constructs a JSON response with a 200 status code and the retrieved items.
3. If an exception occurs during the scan, it constructs a JSON response with a 500 status code and an error message.
___
#### Outputs
- JSON response containing either the retrieved items or an error message, along with the corresponding status code.
___


## `execute_scheduled_task.py` & `lambda_3.zip`
### Summary
This code defines a function named `execute_scheduled_task` that creates an item in an S3 bucket called `taskstorage`. The function takes an event and context as inputs. It retrieves the item content from the event, or uses a default value if not present. It then uses the Boto3 library to create the item in the specified S3 bucket. If successful, it returns a response with a status code of 200 and a message indicating the item was created successfully. If an error occurs, it returns a response with a status code of 500 and an error message.

### Example Usage
```python
event = {
    'item_content': 'Custom item content'
}
context = {}

result = execute_scheduled_task(event, context)
print(result)
```

The code can be used by passing an event dictionary with an optional 'item_content' key to specify the content of the item. The context parameter can be an empty dictionary. The expected output is a dictionary containing the status code and a message or error.

### Code Analysis
#### Inputs
- event: A dictionary containing the event data. It can optionally include an 'item_content' key to specify the content of the item.
- context: A dictionary containing the runtime information of the function.
___
#### Flow
1. The function starts by defining the bucket name and generating a unique item name based on the current timestamp.
2. It checks if the 'item_content' key is present in the event dictionary. If present, it assigns the value to the 'item_content' variable. Otherwise, it assigns a default value.
3. The function attempts to create the item in the specified S3 bucket using the 'put_object' method of the S3 client.
4. If the item creation is successful, the function returns a response dictionary with a status code of 200 and a message indicating the item was created successfully.
5. If an exception occurs during the item creation, the function catches the exception and returns a response dictionary with a status code of 500 and an error message.
___
#### Outputs
- A dictionary containing the response data. It includes a status code and a message or error, depending on the success or failure of the item creation.
